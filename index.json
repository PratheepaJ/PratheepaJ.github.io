[{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"  The KM estimator is a commonly used nonparametric estimator of a survival function, but the KM estimator only defines the approximate probability of observed failure times and may not define a proper density function if the largest observation is right-censored.\nApplication We can apply this method for several event-time data from the clinical research to estimate a smooth survival curve.\n Method We define the empirical moment generating function (MGF) of the tail-completed density function based on the KM estimator, then, using the saddlepoint method, accurately approximate a smooth survival function. Before using the saddlepoint method for this purpose, however, we establish the convergence results of the modified version of the empirical MGF based on the KM estimator using the M-estimation and multivariate delta method.\n Software  R package ESPA.

Several possible procedures exist for estimating model parameters. We refer to some of them as Yule-Walker (YW) estimators (Yule, 1927), least squares estimators, Burg estimators (Burg, 1968), and maximum likelihood estimators. Although the YW estimators produce bias in the estimation, this is a commonly used estimation method in practice.\nApplication Once the AR model is fit to the data, it is common to check the significance of model parameters. We then identify the order of the AR model.\n Method We derive the bivariate saddlepoint density approximation for the YW estimators of AR(2) model parameters. First, we write the sample autocorrelation as the ratio of quadratic forms. Then, we substitute this ratio in the YW equations and derive a system of quadratic estimating equations (QEE). Next, we show that the YW estimators of AR(2) model parameters are roots of QEE. We also show that the Jacobian of the transformation of the QEE coordinate space to the parameter coordinate space is positive semi-definite. Finally, we derive the bivariate saddlepoint density approximation using that of QEE.\n Software  PhD dissertation Chapter II supplement.   Paper  PhD dissertation Chapter II.

We can use either the spatial autoregressive model, conditional autoregressive model, or spatial moving average models to fit the spatial lattice data.\n Method We use the SPBB method to construct confidence intervals for a parameter whose estimator is a unique root of a quadratic estimating equation. In the SPBB method, we use the monotonicity of the quadratic estimating equation in parameter to relate the distribution of an estimator to the distribution of the respective quadratic estimating equation. Using the saddlepoint methods, it is then possible to accurately approximate the distribution of the estimator. Then confidence interval can be produced by pivoting the distribution of the estimator.\n Software  R package SPBBspatial. Tutorial.
