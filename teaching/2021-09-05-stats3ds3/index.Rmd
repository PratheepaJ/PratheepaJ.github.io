# Description

[Course link.](https://academiccalendars.romcmaster.ca/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=41&coid=217177)

# Syllabus

## Course overview

An introduction to data science theory is provided with some focus on analytics. Topics covered include an introduction to [\blc R\bc](http://cran.r-project.org) and other appropriate computational platforms, data types, data manipulation, data frames, data visualization, data reporting, statistical/machine learning, classification, clustering, cross-validation, classification and regression trees, gradient boosting, ridge regression, LASSO, and generalized additive models. Familiarity with some computer package, e.g., SAS, Python, or MatLab, is required. This course includes a scientific communication component. 


## Expected outcomes

Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to: 

* use visualization tools to explore the data using R
* perform analysis using unsupervised and supervised learning methods 
* analyze a real data set of moderate size using R and interpret the output 
* write reusable data analysis reports using [\blc R\bc](http://cran.r-project.org), [\blc RStudio\bc](https://rstudio.com/), and [\blc RMarkdown \bc](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

## Textbook

- Suggested textbooks:
  - **ISLR**: [\blc _An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R_\bc](https://campusstore.mcmaster.ca/cgi-mcm/ws/txsub.pl?wsTERMG1=211&wsDEPTG1=STATS&wsCOURSEG1=3DS3&wsSECTIONG1=DAY%20C01&crit_cnt=1) by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani (Springer, 1st ed., 2013). - available at campus store.
  - **RDS**: [\blc _R for Data Science_\bc](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. - available online.
  - **RMC**: [\blc _R Markdown Cookbook_\bc](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/) by Yihui Xie, Christophe Dervieux, Emily Riederer. - available online.

## Software
This course uses R and RStudio, which are both free. We recommend to set-up the computing environment earlier. We will also use the first-week lab session to ensure everyone is up and running with the computing environment. 

- Install the following software (follow the interactive tutorial to install R and R Studio: [\blc click here\bc](https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-install-r)):
  - R (required): [\blc https://www.r-project.org/\bc](https://www.r-project.org/).
  - RStudio is highly recommended for syntax highlighting, package management, document generation, and more: [\blc https://www.rstudio.com/\bc](https://www.rstudio.com/).
      - The newest version of RStudio is highly recommended.
  - Latex, which will enable you to create PDFs directly from the RMarkdown in RStudio.
      - Install [\blc TinyTex\bc](https://yihui.name/tinytex/) package: `install.packages("tinytex", repos =  "https://cloud.r-project.org/")`.
      - After installing [\blc TinyTex\bc](https://yihui.name/tinytex/), close RStudio.
      - Reopen RStudio.
      - Run the following: `tinytex::install_tinytex()`.
      
      
##  Evaluation

The homework assignments and bonus points will determine the final letter grade for this course:

- Six homework assignments will be assigned.
- The best five assignments will count towards your overall grade.
- Each of your five best assignments will be worth 20% of the final grade.

The final percentage to letter grade conversion will follow McMasterâ€™s Grading Scale.
